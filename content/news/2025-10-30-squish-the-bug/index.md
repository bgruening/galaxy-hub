## Galaxy not working ... really?

When you encounter a problem, report it! Use Galaxy's built-in reporting functionality to let us know about any issues you're experiencing.

[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/rId4s3v57z4?si=t1KdxTNQvP-2b6QS) to learn how to report bugs:

## The bottom line

Galaxy is free. So the ONLY thing we ask in return is to help us track and squish bugs. Do it!
